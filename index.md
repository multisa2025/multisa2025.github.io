## About
Contemporary algorithms for time series management predominantly handle univariate time series. Modern data sources frequently generate richer, multivariate time series. Examples include sensors monitoring multiple variables (e.g., temperature, wind, rainfall), financial time series (bid/ask prices, volume), and data from scientific and medical equipment. Currently, only very few algorithms address the management, analysis, and extraction of insights from such multivariate data. Moreover, existing work is tailored to specific needs. Foundational functionalities that have propelled advancements in univariate time series analysis, e.g., indexing, cannot be trivially extended to the multivariate case. This limitation significantly restricts existing efforts for analyzing multivariate time series. 

This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners working with multivariate time series, to present and discuss open problems and solutions, and to foster collaborations. Industry will participate for presenting requirements and current approaches, and to reach out to the ICDE community. Researchers will share their novel and ongoing work. The workshop will feature:
(a) paper presentations (short papers and demos up to 4 pages, regular papers up to 8 pages -- excluding references),
(b) invited talks from industry and domain experts, 
(c) panel discussion, and time for fostering collaborations. 

All accepted papers will be published by IEEE, in the ICDE workshop proceedings -- alongside the ICDE conference proceedings.

## Keynote Talks
##### Keynote 1: Multivariate Time Series Management and Analysis: An Apache IoTDB Solution
*Shaoxu Song, Tsinghua University*

**Abstract:** Multivariate time series are now prevalent, especially in the IoT scenarios, for monitoring massive devices and supporting decision making. In this talk, we will first introduce some typical scenarios of managing and analyzing multivariate time series, and give an overview on how Apache IoTDB can meet such user requirements. Our solution ranges from storage, compression and curation for time series management, to statistical analysis, machine learning and pre-trained models integrated with the database. We will also share several use cases of IoTDB in real-world applications, and indicate some future directions to advance the study further.

**Bio:** Shaoxu Song is an Associate Professor in the School of Software at Tsinghua University. His research interests include timeseries database, data quality and data mining. He has published more than 80 research papers in top journals and conferences in the area, such as TODS, VLDBJ, TKDE, SIGMOD, KDD, VLDB, and ICDE. Dr. Song served in the editorial (review) boards of PVLDB, JDIQ, JCST and ESWA, the PC Vice-Co-Chair of IEEE BigData 2022/2025 and Area Chair of ACM KDD 2025. He received Outstanding/Distinguished Reviewer awards from KDD 2025, ICDE 2024, VLDB 2019 and CIKM 2017. He is a Senior Member of IEEE.
